Life came to me not as thunder,
but as a shy lamp at dusk,
trembling in the wind of unanswered prayers.
I cupped it with both hands,
afraid my own breath would extinguish it.

Grief followed—
not as an enemy,
but as a barefoot pilgrim
who knew my name
before I learned it myself.

It sat beside me in silence,
teaching me the weight of moments:
how a mother’s cough echoes longer than sound,
how a father’s tired eyes
carry unpaid suns and sleepless moons,
how love often arrives
wrapped in responsibility.

I asked the night,
“Why does joy visit lightly
while sorrow builds a home?”
The night replied by opening the sky—
each star a wound
that learned how to shine.

Life, I see now, is not a promise of ease
but a trust handed quietly to trembling hands.
And grief is not the end of song—
it is the deeper note
that gives the melody its truth.

When tears fall,
the earth does not mock them;
it drinks,
and from that salt
it grows tomorrow.

So let me walk with grief,
not bowed, but awake.
Let me carry my fragile lamp forward,
for even its small flame
is enough
to teach the dark
how to listen.
